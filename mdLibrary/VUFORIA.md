# How to setup Vuforia?
The camera uses [Vuforia](https://developer.vuforia.com) to process the images.  
For it to work you will need to import Vuforia it self to your project. You can find the package on the website.  
If that doesnt work check on youtube how to download it for your unity version.  
After you download it you need to go to the website and make a account and get started on the Develop page  
</br>
## 1. Create a Project.

once you reach develop you will see the projects you have started(in this case its Unity_AR_Test)  
to make a project press the Get Basic button and give your project a name.  
</br>
## 2. Add a Database.
